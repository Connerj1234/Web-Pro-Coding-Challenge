In the crooked tower at the edge of the forest, a witch stirred her cauldron with a bone spoon. She whispered the final word of the spell, and the potion bubbled violently, glowing green.

“Perfect,” she cackled—just before the mixture hissed, sputtered, and exploded in a burst of sparks.

When the smoke cleared, the witch was gone. In her place, a small black bat hung upside down from the rafters, blinking in surprise.

She flapped her wings once, sighed, and muttered in a squeaky voice,
“Back to the recipe book…”
